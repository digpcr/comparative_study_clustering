# Benchmarking digital PCR partition classification methods with empirical and simulated duplex data
## Overview
Digital PCR (dPCR) is a highly accurate technique for the quantification of target nucleic acid(s). dPCR has shown great potential in clinical applications, like tumor liquid biopsy, viral loading monitoring, and infectious diseases.The correct classification of reactions is crucial to obtain an accurate estimate of the concentration of the target nucleic acid(s). Here, we investigated different clustering methods for automated classification of duplex dPCR reactions, in which multiple target molecules are quantified in a single reaction.
